I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at CISPA, Saarland University. My supervisor is Prof. Michael Backes and I am daily advised by Dr. Yang Zhang. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics School, University of Science and Technology of China in 2019, I did my final year thesis under the supervision of Prof. Yu Yu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research mainly concentrates on privacy. Topics include machine learning privacy and lattice-based cryptography.

From July 2018 to Sep 2018, I did my summer research at the University of Tokyo focusing on security evaluation of LWE based cryptosystem, under the supervision of Prof. Tsuyoshi Takagi, and I did an intern in PlatON focusing on implementing a 2-party Ed25519 signature with Dr. Xiang Xie in April 2019.
