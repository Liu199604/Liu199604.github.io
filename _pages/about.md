I graduate from Architectural Engineering Institude of Zhejiang University. My Bachelor Thesis was about the prediction of construction waste by using neural networks and it was under the supervision of [Prof. Haijian Xie](https://person.zju.edu.cn/xiehaijian).

My interested fields include Object Detection, Instance Segmentation and Person Search in Computer Vision. Recently I also have some interests in machine learning security and privacy.

From July 2018 to Sep 2018, I did my summer research at Waseda University.We did the prediction of electricity consumption by using neural networks and distinguished the print errors of student cards by using CNN. These researches were under the supervision of [Prof. Fujimura Shigeru](https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/gips/other/2015/07/15/271/).
