I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at CISPA, Saarland University. My supervisor is [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/director/) and I am daily advised by [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics School, University of Science and Technology of China in 2019, I did my final year thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Yu Yu](http://yuyu.hk/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research mainly concentrates on machine learning privacy and security. Topics include privacy risk in Machine Learning such as membership inference attack and backdoor attack, what's more, I am interested in privacy-preserving machine learning using homomorphic encryption or multi-party computation techniques.

From July 2018 to Sep 2018, I did my summer research at the University of Tokyo focusing on security evaluation of LWE based cryptosystem, under the supervision of [Prof. Tsuyoshi Takagi](http://crypto.mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/members/takagi.html), and I did an intern in PlatON focusing on implementing a 2-party Ed25519 signature with [Dr. Xiang Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiang-xie-37074312a/?originalSubdomain=cn) in April 2019.
