I'm a Ph.D. student at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), and supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/research/groups/backes). Before that I graduated from Zhejiang University.

My research centers on the security and privacy of machine learning systems, bridging foundational studies on privacy leakage with emerging risks in generative AI. Having established rigorous benchmarks for membership inference and data reconstruction using LLMs, I am now pivoting my research to address the security challenges of Large Reasoning Models and autonomous Agents. My goal is to uncover unique vulnerabilities in these advanced systems and develop robust safeguards against their misuse.
